        Find a good set of points to estimate the gradient at point ``c`` by fitting a
        polynomial of degree ``degree`` on the interval ``[a, b]``.

        Functions implementing that interface find ``num_points`` unique points ``x``
        between ``a`` and ``b`` that will be used to fit a polynomial of degree
        ``degree``.

        Different implementation might choose to minimise different quantities. For
        example:

        - minimise code complexity, by simply returning linear (or log-spaced) points,
        - minimise the variance of the resulting gradient estimation, for example using
          a D-optimal design (sees
          https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_experimental_design).

        Args:
            a (float): lower bound of the interval in which fitting points should be
                computed.
            b (float): upper bound of the interval in which fitting points should be
                computed.
            c (float): point at which the gradient will be estimated.
            num_points (int): number of points to return within ``[a, b]``.
            degree (int): degree of the polynomial that will be used to fit the values
                computed at each of the points returned by this function.

        Returns:
            a sorted array of ``num_points`` points within ``[a, b]`` and without duplicates
